Contract operators will be provided with forms for all the supplies they operate. Blank forms will
be available for MDNR Regional Office staff use.

3. The form requires all requested information to be printed by the collector. There are no longer
check boxes for Sample Type or Repeat Location.

4. Facility ID, Sample Collection Point ID and Location for the sampling site MUST be
provided by the collector. This information is available from your MDNR approved PWS
sampling plan. MDNR will be providing all public water systems with a current copy of their
approved sampling plan. This information is required by SDWIS and is used by MDNR to
ensure regulatory compliance requirements have been met. Failure to complete this information
on the sample collection form may result in a non-compliance report from MDNR.

5. A Collector Signature line has been added. The sample collector must sign the form to attest the
information provided is accurate to the best of their knowledge.

The MSPHL will begin shipping the new forms to public water systems in late November or early
December. Please begin using the new forms December 16, 2015. Discard all the old forms (“cards”)
at that time.

NEW SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONS:

Sample instructions have been revised to include changes to the bottle and sampling form. The
instructions include detailed information on how to collect the sample using the new bottle, how to
complete the new sample collection form, how to best ship samples to the MSPHL using the free
MSPHL courier system, and how to register for the new MSPHL web portal. A copy of these
instructions is attached.

NEW WEB PORTAL FOR RESULTS REPORTS

The OE LIMS provides a web portal that may be used by systems to view and print their test result
reports, check status of samples, download sample information into Excel, and receive automated emails
when samples are received at the laboratory, and when sample results are ready to be viewed. For
information on how to gain access to this portal, please contact Shondra Johnson, LIMS Administrator
at Shondra.Johnson@health.mo.gov or at 573-751-3334.

IMPLEMENTATION DATES:

The MSPHL intends to implement the OpenELIS LIMS on December 1, 2015. There will be a two
week testing period in which laboratory staff will run the new LIMS in conjunction with our current
manual, paper-based system to ensure the OE LIMS is operating properly. You may continue to submit
samples as you currently do, using the old sample information card, throughout this time.

On December 16, 2015, the MSPHL plans to “go-live” with the new OE LIMS. Samples submitted
after that date should be submitted on the new Environmental Sample Collection Form. At that time, the
MSPHL Test Results Web Portal will also be available to those systems that have been granted access.
The MSPHL and MDNR understand that there will be a lot of changes to a system that has been in place
for many years. The MSPHL is excited about the added benefits from this new system, and we ask for
your patience as we implement the OpenELIS LIMS at the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory.

If you have any questions, please contact the MSPHL Environmental Bacteriology Unit at 573-751-
3334. You may also contact your MDNR Regional Office for additional information on sample
collection.

Once again, thank you for your patience and understanding as we implement these changes.
